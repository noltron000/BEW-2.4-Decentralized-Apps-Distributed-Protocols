## 📖 [**20m**] Overview: Sidechains

### What is the Loom Network and Plasma?

Plasma does the hard work of integrating sidechains on the Mainnet for you, leaving you, the developer, to work on building your Ðapp. The Loom Network is a sidechain that has a collection of even smaller sidechains operating on it. The above image shows the network (right), with various Ðapp operating on smaller sidechains (the circles within the main loop). It runs on the mantra “1 Ðapp, 1 Sidechain”.

### Why You Should Know This

Ethereum is big and exciting, unfortunately it’s also somewhat slow and expensive. Ethereum has three goals: Security, Decentralized, Scalability. It’s priorities, however, place Security and Decentralization at the top. This is known as the Ethereum “Trilema”: the perception that one can’t have all three of these things, without sacrificing the benefits of at least one. Changes for scalability might mean compromising security, or making it more centralized. Something many Ethereum users believe would fundamentality go against what the technology stands for. So what can be done?

Enter sidechains. The basic argument is that you don’t need the same level of security when say, changing the hair of your CryptoZombies, that you need for transferring millions of Ether. Sidechains do a whole lot of the work on a smaller, faster, cheaper chain, leaving only the major elements (such as transferring artifacts like an ERC721) for the Ethereum Mainnet. On top of this, many transactions this way can be “gas less”, meaning you don’t have to pay for it!
